# GuessMyNumber
Exercise for class to help us understand Bisection Algorithm. 
# Assignment
Implement bisection algorithm

Write a console application implementing the bisection algorithm. As the initial list, use an integer array from 1 to 10, like this: int[] list = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10;. As input, have the user select a number from 1 to 10. Have the application print each step. Use appropriate exception handling to guard against invalid input from the user.

Guess my number, human plays

Implement a version of Guess My Number, where the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 1000, and the human guesses the number. In this case, the program should print a hint with each repetition, either <Your guess was too high>, <Your guess was too low>, or <You guessed the number>. The human should then input the next guess. Run this multiple times and compute the average number of repetitions necessary for you to guess the number.

What is the maximum number of guesses you need to guess a number between 1 and 1000? Recall that log2 1000 = 9.966 and that 210 = 1024.

Guess my number, computer plays

Implement a version of Guess My Number, where the human chooses a number between 1 and 100, and the computer guesses the number. The human should be able to tell the computer whether the computerâ€™s guess was too high, too low, or was the correct answer. Run this multiple times and compute the average number of repetitions necessary for the computer to guess the number. Have the program print the value, the guess, and the list on each repetition.

Is the human as good as the computer in finding the number?
